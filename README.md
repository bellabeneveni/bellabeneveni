- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @bellabeneveni, Isabella Beneveni Smith
- ðŸ‘€ Starting to code in Python, Java and Javascript :)
- I am truly passionate about technology!
- I have solid experience in Human Resources, this was the area that introduced me to the Tech World, where I found my true calling in software development!
- At this moment, I am studying more about different programming languages, cloud technology (such as AWS and GCP), using GIT and Github and learning more about software best practices.
